# Unity3DProject-ValleyGame
This is my university VR research project. We use shimmer to detect people's psychological arousal. Basically, we are using a comparative experiment to compare people psychological arousal in lower task load environemnt, and higher take load environment. ü•≥ü•≥ <br/>
## Task 
- [x] Research 
- [x] Prototyping 
- [x] Software Development 
- [x] User Testing 


## Noticed: This game is a lower task load game environment, in which participants won't be encouraged to have the intensive mental and physical workload

The Shimmer3 GSR+ (Galvanic Skin Response) unit provides connections and preamplification for one channel of Galvanic Skin Response data acquisition (Electrodermal Resistance Measurement - EDR/Electrodermal Activity (EDA). The GSR+ unit is suitable for measuring the electrical characteristics or conductance of your skin, as well as capturing an Optical Pulse/PPG (Photoplethysmogram) signal and converting to estimate heart rate (HR), using the Shimmer ear clip or optical pulse probe.
## Data collection

Even though, the emotional state, has a signiÔ¨Åcant impact on HR and HRV, the cardiovascular system can also be inÔ¨Çuenced by other factors, including metabolism and activity level. It is more diÔ¨Écult to detect emotional state from HR and HRV metrics than from skin conductance.The galvanic skin resistance (GSR) is an accessible & sensitive index of peripheral sympathetic nervous activity, reÔ¨Çecting peripheral autonomic change.

It measures of the continuous variations in the electrical characteristics of the skin. It can reÔ¨Çect on the changes in sweat gland activity which is an indicator of the intensity of our emotional state, also known as emotional arousal. However, skin conductance can vary from people to people as it is aÔ¨Äected by many subject-dependent and environmental factors, such as skin dryness and temperature. However, the skin conductance is normalized to each individual.
