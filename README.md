# Unity3DProject-ValleyGame
This is my university VR research project. We use shimmer to detect people's psychological arousal. Basically, we are using a comparative experiment to compare people psychological arousal in lower task load environemnt, and higher take load environment. ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ <br/>

## Noticed: This game is a lower task load game environment, in which participants won't be encouraged to have the intensive mental and physical workload
